                    <br/><br/>I spend my time studying algorithm questions and learning new technologies. I love coding things that have a practical use and look forward to working with a team soon.

                    <br/><br/>When I am away from my desk, I tend to be working on art, hanging with friends and family, watching movies, wandering the forest.</p>
